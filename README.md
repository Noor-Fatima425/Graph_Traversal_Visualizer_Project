# Graph_Traversal_Visualizer_Project

Graph traversal algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to explore and analyse relationships between nodes in a graph data structure. Visualising these algorithms helps in understanding their operation and effectiveness. 

This project aims to create an interactive web application that visualises various graph traversal algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The Graph Traversal Visualizer project combines theory with practical implementation by leveraging web technologies to create an interactive learning environment for graph traversal algorithms.

In summary, the Graph Traversal Visualizer project aims to enhance learning and practical application of graph traversal algorithms through an interactive web-based approach. By leveraging the accessibility and interactivity of web technologies, it aims to inspire curiosity and foster deeper understanding in the field of computer science and algorithm design.
